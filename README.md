# Description
In this project I solve chess board game with alpha_beta pruning algorithm with min-max algorithms.
condition: the player always starts the game.
# TODO
- improve alpha_beta pruning algorithm
  - increase search depth
- improve min-max algorithm
  - use generated min-max tree everytime instrad of generating tree everytime
